Please note the failing tests commented in block comments. Showed multiple ways of testing only because didn't know the standards that should be implemented without talking with the team and product owner.
To run the tests please npm or yarn install then Cd into the source file then type npm test (the scripts have been set up to run mocha with typescript).
